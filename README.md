# 🌟 Computer Vision Project Repository

Welcome to my Computer Vision Project repository! This repository showcases my work using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. It includes various stages of data preparation, augmentation, and model training.

Feel free to explore the contents, provide feedback, or reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. 📂 Image Data

This folder contains images categorized into three cases:

- 🌿 **Healthy**: Images of healthy plants
- 🍂 **Early Blight**: Images of plants affected by early blight
- 🍁 **Late Blight**: Images of plants affected by late blight

### 2. ⚙️ Data Optimization

Optimizations applied to the dataset include:

- 🔄 **Prefetch**: Improving data loading efficiency
- 🗄️ **Cache**: Caching data to speed up training

### 3. 🔄 Data Augmentation

Techniques used for data augmentation to enhance model performance:

- 📈 Random rotations
- 🔄 Flipping
- 🌈 Color adjustments

### 4. 🧠 Model Training

The model was trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras, achieving significant results in classifying the plant images.
